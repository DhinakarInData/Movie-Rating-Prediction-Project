# 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction Project

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to predict movie ratings using machine learning models. The dataset includes various details about movies, such as genre, director, and actors, and the goal is to predict the rating of each movie.

## 📂 Data Sources
- **Movie_dataset.csv**: The dataset with detailed information about movies.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

### 📥 Data Loading
Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for processing.

### 🧹 Data Cleaning
Clean the data by removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values to ensure data quality.

### 🔤 Feature Encoding
Encode categorical features into numerical values to make them suitable for machine learning models.

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform EDA to understand data distribution, detect patterns, and identify correlations between features.

### 🚀 Model Training
Train a machine learning model to predict movie ratings based on the features.

### 📊 Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.

## 🧩 Detailed Steps

### 1. Data Loading
